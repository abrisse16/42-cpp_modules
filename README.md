<summary>Exercise 00: Megaphone</summary>

In this exercise, we have to write a program that takes any number of arguments and prints them on the standard output, after turning them into uppercase if they are alphabetic characters.

<summary>Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook</summary>

This program is a small phonebook that can store up to 8 contacts. It has 3 commands :
- ADD: adds a new contact to the phonebook
- SEARCH: displays the list of all the contacts in the phonebook, with their index, and asks the user to enter the index of the contact he wants to see in detail
- EXIT: exits the program

Each contact has 5 fields: first name, last name nickname, phone number and darkest secret.

<summary>Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams (bonus)</summary>

In this exercise, we are given two files which will help us recreate a class and its member functions. The output of the program, using our class, should be the same as the log file given.

This module is designed to help us understand the memory allocation, references, pointers to members and the usage of the switch in CPP.
